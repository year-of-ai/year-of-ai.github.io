# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Org Content Hub (federated)**: tooling to publish one GitHub Pages site per
  org repository — each renders its own content at `<org>.github.io/<repo>/`
  with this theme via `remote_theme`; content never leaves the source repo.
  Adds the `_data/hub.yml` registry with auto-discovery, a shared
  `scripts/lib/hub.rb`, `scripts/provision-org-sites.{rb,sh}` to roll the Pages
  scaffold (`templates/org-site/*`) out to org repos and enable Pages,
  `scripts/sync-hub-metadata.{rb,sh}` to refresh API-only dashboard data
  (`_data/hub_index.yml` + `_data/navigation/hub.yml`, deterministic), a `/hub/`
  dashboard page that tracks every site's live/pending status, and a daily
  `hub-sync.yml` workflow that commits only when the org changed
  (see `docs/systems/content-hub.md`)

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Version bump: minor release

### Commits in this release
- 341cc675 feat(chat): add AI chatbot widget with page context (#33)
- 5a35597a feat(scripts): add consumer audit tooling and theme manifest (#110)

### Added
- **AI Chat Assistant (ZER0-060)**: opt-in floating chat widget grounded in the current page's content, with proxy-first auth — renders nothing until `ai_chat.enabled` plus a deployed proxy (`proxy_ready: true`) or an explicit direct-mode key are configured; FAB positioning/stacking driven by the design tokens (new `--zer0-layer-fab-chat`)

### Fixed
- **Chat render guard**: the original guard used boolean expressions inside Liquid `assign` tags (always truthy), which would have rendered a dead chat button on every page; computed with if-tags instead
- **Locale independence**: `scripts/lint-pages` (via `scripts/lib/frontmatter.sh`) read pages with the locale-dependent default encoding, reporting every multibyte post as a YAML parse error under a C locale; now reads UTF-8 explicitly and the T-015 locale guard covers it

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Version bump: minor release

### Commits in this release
- 85d0295a feat(quality): implement six backlog tasks — T-003/004/008/014/015/016 (#144)
- 71b8fe46 fix(gemspec): require Ruby >= 3.2 to match modern dependency floor (#93)

### Added
- **Contribution templates (T-003)**: bug-report and feature-request issue forms, contact links, and a PR template with the conventional-commit/CHANGELOG/test checklist
- **Locale-independence guard (T-015)**: lib test suite runs the roadmap/backlog/preflight validators under `LC_ALL=C LANG=C` so the UTF-8 crash class fixed in 1.12.1 cannot return

### Fixed
- **Theme customizer (T-008)**: YAML export now quotes hex color values in both builders — unquoted `#RRGGBB` parsed as a YAML comment and silently dropped colors; frozen regression test promoted to live
- **Docs lint baseline (T-004/T-014)**: ~1,600 markdownlint violations fixed or config-tuned to zero (MD060 disabled as post-config stylistic noise, MD025 front-matter handling, MD024 siblings-only); a stray code fence that swallowed the troubleshooting "Advanced Topics" section into a code block repaired; table pipes escaped; 15 dead README links remapped to the reorganized `docs/` tree
- **site_generation suite (T-016)**: `jekyll build` failures now fail the suite instead of degrading to warnings (missing-bundler skip retained)

### Changed
- **Docs lint gate (T-014)**: both `|| true` suppressions removed from `docs-validate.yml` — markdownlint now blocks on a zero-violation baseline

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Version bump: minor release

### Commits in this release
- 5de341aa feat(security): sanitize sensitive config lines in admin config-page DOM (T-009) (#140)
- 42468785 chore(deps): update Ruby gem dependencies (#129)
- 89e21988 Improve LinkedIn share flow with cleaned article summary (#99)

### Security
- **Admin config page (T-009 hardening)**: added a pure-Liquid line-redaction layer for the hidden `<pre id="cfg-full-yaml">` element — the `sanitize_config_yaml` plugin filter shipped in 1.13.1 does not run on GitHub Pages builds (safe mode ignores custom plugins, and the unknown filter is a silent no-op), so Pages-built sites were still injecting raw config; the Liquid layer protects every build path, with the plugin filter kept as defense-in-depth

### Fixed
- **Workflow lint (T-017)**: `version-bump.yml` now passes the repo yamllint config (trailing spaces, bracket spacing, sequence indentation) — these pre-existing violations failed the `auto-version` integration suite on every code PR once the T-012 gate went live; YAML verified semantically identical before/after
- **Changelog tooling**: `update_changelog_file` normalizes trailing newlines on the entry, guaranteeing exactly one blank line before the next release block even when callers pass entries via command substitution (review feedback on the T-012 PR)

## [1.13.1] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Version bump: patch release

### Commits in this release
- 583fa997 fix(infra): sanitize sensitive config keys before DOM injection (T-009) (#141)

### Security
- **Admin config page sanitization (T-009)**: the hidden `<pre id="cfg-full-yaml">` element on the admin config page now has values masked for keys matching `api_key`, `secret`, `password`, `token`, and `phc_` (PostHog) prefixes via a new `sanitize_config_yaml` Liquid filter (`_plugins/sanitize_config_filter.rb`); the corresponding Playwright regression guard (`test/visual/security.spec.js`) is promoted from `test.fixme` to a live test

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Version bump: minor release

### Commits in this release
- cee6f379 feat(ci): gate PRs on the full canonical test entrypoint (T-012) (#138)

### Added
- **CI gate parity (T-012)**: the `ci.yml` test job now runs every non-Playwright theme suite (core, deployment, quality, installation, installer, site_generation, obsidian) plus the canonical `./scripts/bin/test` script suites (lib unit, theme validate, integration, installer e2e) on every code PR — previously only `core,quality,installation` gated, which is how three suites rotted unnoticed before PR #132; a "Gate Coverage — What Enforces What" table in `.github/workflows/README.md` now documents the controls contract

### Fixed
- **Release changelog path**: `version-bump.yml` now inserts release entries via the shared `update_changelog_file` library instead of an inline `head`/`tail` prepend that duplicated (and regressed) the insertion logic — the 1.12.1 release had pushed the file preamble below its entry and stranded the pending `[Unreleased]` notes; both repaired in this file

## [1.12.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Zer0-Mistake Quality Framework (planning)**: new roadmap milestone v1.13 and backlog tasks T-012–T-015 to close the gap between the repo's quality gates and what CI enforces — CI gate parity with the canonical `./scripts/bin/test` entrypoint (whose integration suites previously rotted unnoticed), re-armed pixel-snapshot and docs link-check gates, and a locale-independence regression guard; coverage baseline task T-005 repointed at the new milestone

### Changed
- Version bump: patch release

### Commits in this release
- 846bd9ff chore(backlog): plan the Zer0-Mistake Quality Framework (roadmap v1.13, T-012–T-015) (#133)
- 33a727c0 docs: expand CLAUDE.md into a comprehensive Claude Code guide (#131)

## [1.12.1] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- Version bump: patch release
- **Roadmap**: advanced to track the shipped gem — v1.9 marked completed, v1.10 (Roadmap Validation) and v1.11 (Continuous-Evolution Loop) recorded, v1.12 (Headless Endpoints) is the active milestone (closes backlog T-001, T-002)
- **Changelog**: restored the Keep a Changelog preamble at the top of this file

### Fixed
- **Tooling encoding**: `generate-roadmap.rb`, `sync-backlog.rb`, and `scripts/bin/validate` now read repo files as UTF-8 explicitly, fixing `invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII` crashes in environments without a UTF-8 locale (minimal containers, some CI runners) — `generate-roadmap.sh --check` and `validate --quick` both crashed in such environments
- **Test suite**: repaired the three test suites that failed on `main`:
  - `scripts/test/integration/auto-version` rewritten against the current release architecture (`scripts/analyze-commits.sh` wrapper, `scripts/utils/analyze-commits`, `scripts/bin/release`, `version-bump.yml`) — it previously targeted the retired `gem-publish.sh`/`auto-version-bump.yml` and aborted under `set -e` due to `((var++))` returning non-zero
  - `scripts/test/integration/mermaid` repointed at `pages/_docs/features/mermaid-diagrams.md` (the doc moved from `pages/_docs/jekyll/`) and at the current Bootstrap-aware theming instead of the removed forest theme/FontAwesome config
  - `_layouts/search.html` given a front matter block so theme layout validation passes
- **Changelog tooling**: `update_changelog_file` now folds any pending `## [Unreleased]` section into the new release entry and inserts before the first release heading (preserving the file preamble) — stale Unreleased blocks no longer accumulate mid-file; the eight historical stray blocks were folded into the releases that shipped them

- 8a5ba7e2 feat(ci): add continuous-evolution backlog loop (#114)

### Added
- **Continuous-evolution loop**: a self-sustaining backlog mechanism so AI agents can keep improving the repo between human sessions.
  - `_data/backlog.yml` — tactical task queue (single source of truth), mirroring the `_data/roadmap.yml` pattern.
  - `scripts/sync-backlog.rb` (+ `scripts/sync-backlog.sh`) — schema validator and GitHub Issues sync (idempotent via `<!-- backlog-id -->` markers).
  - `.github/workflows/backlog-sync.yml` — syncs the backlog to issues on push to `main`; validates schema on PRs.
  - `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` — enables native auto-merge for low-risk (`docs`/`deps`/`lint`) PRs once CI is green.
  - `.github/prompts/repo-audit.prompt.md` (`/repo-audit`) and `.github/prompts/backlog-implement.prompt.md` (`/backlog-implement`) — the audit and implement routines.
  - `.github/instructions/backlog.instructions.md` — file-scoped guidance for the backlog.
  - `docs/systems/continuous-evolution.md` — full design, autonomy policy, and setup.
  - `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code pointer to `AGENTS.md` (per the documented convention).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed
- Version bump: minor release

### Commits in this release
- 8a2bd84 feat(install): modular installer with deploy plugins, AI wizard pipeline, scrape v2, and test suite (#111)

### Added
- **Modular installer (`scripts/install/`)**: spec-driven, AI-aware installer dispatched by `scripts/bin/install`. Single `.zer0/install.spec.json` contract feeds CLI flags, the TUI wizard, and the OpenAI wizard into one apply pipeline.
- **Deploy plugins**: `tasks/deploy_github-pages.sh`, `tasks/deploy_azure-swa.sh`, `tasks/deploy_docker-prod.sh`. Spec deploy targets now auto-render the matching workflow / config from `templates/deploy/`.
- **AI wizard end-to-end**: `install wizard --ai` now chains spec generation → `apply_run`, records AI provenance (`ai.used/provider/model`) in the spec, lets CLI flags override AI guesses, and falls back to profile defaults when the model returns empty arrays.
- **Profile defaults fallback**: `ai/wizard.sh` re-loads the selected profile to fill in empty `deploy`/`agents` arrays from the AI output, ensuring decisive installs.
- **`generic` agent target** added to spec schema enum (cross-tool `AGENTS.md` baseline alongside `claude`, `cursor`, `aider`, `copilot`).
- **Installer test suite (`test/test_installer.sh`)**: 17-check regression harness covering module syntax, all 6 profile inits, all 3 deploy plugins, all 5 agent flavours, and the AI wizard pipeline. Wired into `test/test_runner.sh` as the `installer` suite (included in `--suites all` and `--suites full`).
- **Site scraping (`install scrape <URL>` + `install init --scrape <URL>`)**: new `scripts/install/scrape.sh` BFS crawler + stdlib-only `scripts/install/scrape_html.py` extractor convert any existing website into a fully-rendered zer0-mistakes site. Now distributes pages by detected `kind`: home → `index.md` with `permalink: /`, events → `pages/events/<slug>.md`, posts → `pages/news/<slug>.md`, rest → `pages/<slug>.md`. Downloads referenced images into `assets/scraped/` and rewrites markdown to local paths. Wires navigation into `_data/navigation/main.yml` (the file the theme actually reads) with kind-based Bootstrap Icons, filters junk labels (Back / Cart / Folder:) and `?format=ical`/`?format=json` URLs, skips commerce paths (`/cart`, `/checkout`, `/login`). Seeds `_config.yml` `title`/`description`/`lang`/`logo` from `og:`/`<html lang>` metadata. New flags: `--scrape URL`, `--scrape-depth N` (default 2), `--scrape-max-pages N` (default 25). Covered by `test/test_install_scrape.sh` (standalone + init-integration, asserts new layout + nav cleanliness).

### Fixed
- `_cmd_wizard` previously left targets containing only `.zer0/install.spec.json`; now chains `apply_run` to write all task outputs.
- `plan.sh` YAML parser now accepts both `deploy:`/`deploy_targets:` keys and parses `agents:` block lists *and* `ai_features.agent_files:` inline flow lists, matching the actual profile YAML shape.
- Rewrote `ai/prompts/wizard.system.md` with explicit profile, deploy, and agent heuristics plus a full example output, eliminating empty AI responses.
- `plan_load_profile` and `plan_apply_flags` now return `0` explicitly so Bash 3.2 doesn't propagate a trailing-test exit code.


## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Version bump: patch release

### Changed
- **Gem packaging**: `jekyll-theme-zer0.gemspec` now excludes `assets/images/` (287 MB of content previews/author photos), `assets/backgrounds/`, `.DS_Store` files, and binary media outside `assets/vendor/`, reducing gem payload to ~8.9 MB


## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

### Commits in this release
- 580f2b4 perf: Jekyll build performance improvements + MathJax 3 fix + richer Obsidian cache (#100)

### Added
- **Design system & layouts**: Sass token layers (`_sass/tokens/`), component and layout partials (`_sass/components/`, `_sass/layouts/`), skins (`theme_skins.yml` + `_sass/theme/_skins.scss`), utilities, and developer docs (`docs/design-system.md`, `design-tokens.md`, `theming.md`, `layouts-and-navigation.md`, and related guides). Homepage sections are driven by `_data/landing.yml` per `_includes/components/README.md`.
- **Navigation & chrome**: Drawer/TOC FAB and sidebar visibility modules (`assets/js/modules/navigation/`), `appearance.js` theme helper, refreshed navbar/footer/breadcrumb markup aligned with Bootstrap 5.3.
- **Statistics**: `_plugins/content_statistics_generator.rb` optionally regenerates `_data/content_statistics.yml` during `jekyll build` (toggle via `content_statistics.auto_generate`); `./scripts/generate-content-statistics.sh` delegates to `_data/generate_statistics.sh` and is wired from `rake stats:generate`.
- **Testing**: Expanded Playwright coverage (`test/visual/ui-refresh.spec.js`, `layouts.spec.js`) and refreshed smoke visuals/`results.json` for the new chrome.

### Changed
- **Testing**: Consolidated three Playwright configs into a single `test/playwright.config.js` with `smoke`, `snapshots`, and `regression-{chromium,firefox,webkit}` projects (tiers). The new `test/test_playwright.sh` runner replaces `test_styling.sh` and selects the tier via `PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT`. Snapshot baselines now live in `test/visual/snapshots/` (committed Linux images) and can be refreshed via the new `test/update-snapshots.sh` Docker helper.
- **CI**: Split the styling step in `ci.yml` into a Playwright smoke step (every code-change PR) and a path-filtered Playwright snapshot step (only when `_sass/`, `assets/`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `test/visual/` change); both go through the new reusable `.github/actions/playwright-tests` composite action and upload `test/visual-results/` artifacts on failure (14-day retention) for easier triage.
- **Performance**: `setup-banner.html` — added `{% raw %}{% unless site.site_configured %}{% endraw %}` early-exit guard that skips all setup detection logic and the `setup-check.html` sub-include when `site_configured: true`; eliminated 151 redundant include renders per build (-87% per-render time, setup-check fully eliminated from profile)
- **Performance**: `info-section.html` — replaced full-site URL megastring (`site.html_pages | map | join`) with a single pre-filtered admin-page lookup (`where_exp: "p.url contains '/about/'"`) that accesses `site.html_pages` once and builds a ~10-entry string instead of 150+, making `contains` checks ~18× faster
- **Performance**: `sidebar-right.html` — added heading-presence guard before calling the expensive `toc.html` Liquid parser; pages without `<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<h4>` headings skip TOC generation entirely (-18% per-render for `toc.html`)
- **Performance**: Made MathJax loading conditional via `page.mathjax` front matter flag (mirrors Mermaid pattern) — saves 1.8 MB transfer on pages without math
- **Performance**: Cached Obsidian plugin wiki-link index across incremental builds — index is rebuilt only when document URLs, titles, or aliases change
- **Performance**: Disabled `notebooks`, `hobbies`, and `quests` collections in dev config for faster local builds
- **Performance**: Removed jQuery from page loads — Bootstrap 5.3.3 does not require it and no custom JS uses jQuery APIs

### Fixed
- **Accessibility**: Dynamically-rendered color inputs in the Theme Customizer (Skin Editor gradient stops in `assets/js/skin-editor.js` and Live Preview pickers in `assets/js/palette-generator.js`) now have associated `<label for>` elements and `aria-label`s, fixing a regression that left them inaccessible to assistive tech.
- **Tests**: `test/visual/theme-colors.spec.js` now activates the Color Editor tab and waits for the panel to be visible before interacting, eliminating a 45 s `locator.fill` timeout caused by hitting hidden inputs in inactive tabs.
- **Tests**: Replaced flaky `waitForTimeout(300)` and `networkidle` calls in `test/visual/fixtures.js` and `test/visual/skins.spec.js` with deterministic waits on `domcontentloaded`, `load`, the `data-theme-skin` attribute, and the `zer0:skin-change` event.
- **Tests**: Retired the legacy `test/test_visual.sh` (ImageMagick + bash screenshot pipeline) and the placeholder `homepage-*-chromium-darwin.png` baselines in favor of the unified Playwright snapshot tier.
- Added missing `mathjax: true` front matter to pages that use math notation (test-notebook.md, jupyter-notebooks.md, jekyll-math-symbols-with-mathjax.md)
- **MathJax 3 inline math**: Added `window.MathJax` config block before the script tag so `$...$` inline math (used in test-notebook.md) renders correctly — MathJax 3 does not enable dollar-sign inline delimiters by default
- Updated `mathjax-math.md` documentation to show MathJax 3 API (`window.MathJax = {}`) instead of the removed MathJax 2 `MathJax.Hub.Config` API

### Tests
- Added `ObsidianCacheTest` suite (5 new tests) covering fingerprint invalidation on document addition, title change, alias change, cache hit, and cache miss

### Changed (UI/UX)
- **Sidebar collapse — VS Code style**: Left sidebar (`#bdSidebar`) and right TOC (`#tocContents`) now collapse to a slim 36 px rail (`--zer0-sidebar-rail-width`) instead of being fully hidden on desktop. The visibility toggle icon (`bi-layout-sidebar-inset` / `bi-layout-sidebar-inset-reverse`) stays mounted on the rail so users can re-expand the panel with a single click — the floating action buttons (`.bd-sidebar-fab`, `.bd-toc-fab`) are now hidden at `≥992 px` since the rail toggle replaces them. `_sass/core/_docs-layout.scss`, `_sass/layouts/_navbar-extras.scss`.
- **Smooth transitions**: `.bd-layout` and `.bd-main` now animate `grid-template-columns` and `gap` over `--zer0-motion-duration-base` (0.3 s) with `--zer0-motion-ease-standard`; sidebar contents cross-fade via `opacity` + delayed `visibility`. Honors `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` by disabling all related transitions.
- **Toggle behavior**: `sidebar-visibility.js` and `toc-visibility.js` no longer set `button.hidden = true` on the rail toggle when collapsed, keeping it interactive in the collapsed state. Aria labels (`Hide…` / `Show…`) update on each toggle.
- **Cache-bust**: Added `?v={{ site.time | date: '%s' }}` to the navigation ES-module `<script type="module">` tag in `_includes/components/js-cdn.html` to force re-fetch on rebuild (browsers cache ES modules indefinitely by URL).
- **Navbar dropdown**: Dropdown toggle button set to `align-self: stretch` so it spans the full navbar height, making it easier to invoke on touch/small screens; chevron icon `font-size` increased to `1em` for better legibility. `_sass/core/_navbar.scss`.
- **Syntax highlighting**: Dual-palette system — `_sass/core/_syntax.scss` now uses a GitHub Light palette for `.highlight` (light mode) and scopes the Material Dark base16 palette to `[data-bs-theme="dark"] .highlight`, fixing near-invisible token colors on light backgrounds.
- **Theme preview gallery**: Expanded to 20 sections with 6 new components: Callouts (5 types), Accordion, Progress & Spinners, Breadcrumb & Pagination, Tooltips & Popovers, and Icons showcase. TOC updated accordingly; Bootstrap tooltip/popover JS initializer added. `_includes/components/theme-preview-gallery.html`, `pages/_about/settings/theme-preview.md`.

### Fixed (UI)
- **Contrast skin — light mode**: The `contrast` skin's `zer0-skin-palette` mixin sets `--bs-link-color: #ffffff` (white accent) which rendered sidebar nav links invisible on a white background in light mode. Added `[data-theme-skin="contrast"]:not([data-bs-theme="dark"])` override in `_sass/theme/_skins.scss` to pin link color to `#111111` in light mode while leaving dark-mode behavior unchanged.

### Changed
- **Docker/Jekyll build performance** — Reduced repeated full-page Liquid scans in the footer, settings offcanvas, and cookie consent includes; cached preview image checks during generation; skipped server-side Obsidian rewrites for documents without Obsidian syntax; and changed Docker dev startup to run `bundle install` only when `bundle check` reports missing dependencies. The profiled Docker build improved from 119.2s to 86.8s in local validation.

### Added
- **Example Posts**: Added twelve new section examples across Business,
  Development, Science, Technology, Tutorial, and World posts to provide
  richer sample content for `_posts` category sections.
- **Development Automation**: Added `scripts/bin/validate` and `scripts/validate`
  as the canonical preflight validation command for repository files, version
  consistency, YAML/data parsing, active configuration contracts, config-file
  classification, navigation data shape, Jekyll build/doctor, compiled assets,
  and optional tests/Obsidian/HTMLProofer checks. CI fast checks now call
  `./scripts/bin/validate --quick`.
- **Obsidian Integration** — The repo's markdown content is now editable as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault and rendered identically on GitHub Pages.
  - Shared vault config (`.obsidian/app.json`, `core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json`, `appearance.json`, `hotkeys.json`, `templates.json`) and a Templates-compatible note template at `pages/_notes/_templates/note-template.md`.
  - Liquid-generated `assets/data/wiki-index.json` listing every collection document and standalone page (title, basename, permalink, tags, aliases, excerpt) — works on the default GitHub Pages remote_theme build, no plugin whitelist changes required.
  - `assets/js/obsidian-wiki-links.js` — client-side resolver that rewrites `[[wiki-links]]` (with aliases, header anchors, broken-link styling), `![[embeds]]` (image with width modifiers, note transclusion), inline `#tags`, and Obsidian callout blockquotes (`> [!note] Title …`) into Bootstrap-styled HTML.
  - `_includes/content/backlinks.html` — server-side backlinks panel auto-rendered on every `note` layout (and on any page with `backlinks: true`); fully indexable by search engines.
  - `_includes/content/transclude.html` — note embed renderer used by both the JS resolver and the Ruby converter.
  - `_sass/core/_obsidian.scss` (imported via `_sass/custom.scss`) — styles for wiki-links, broken links, callouts, embeds, and the backlinks panel.
  - `_plugins/obsidian_links.rb` — opt-in Ruby converter that performs the same transformations server-side for forks that build with vanilla Jekyll (without the `github-pages` gem) or use a custom GH Actions workflow that bypasses the plugin whitelist.
  - `pages/_docs/obsidian/` — full documentation section: index, getting started, syntax reference, authoring workflow, troubleshooting.
  - `_config.yml` — added `*.canvas` and `*.excalidraw.md` to `exclude:`; `jekyll-redirect-from` enabled to map Obsidian `aliases:` to URL redirects.
  - `.gitignore` — ignore Obsidian's local-only state (`workspace*`, `cache`, `plugins/*/data.json`, `graph.json`, `.trash/`).
- **Tests**:
  - `test/test_ruby_converter.rb` — 18-test, 65-assertion Minitest suite for `_plugins/obsidian_links.rb` covering wiki-links, embeds, callouts (including fold markers and unknown-type fallback), inline tags, code-block isolation, and a plain-markdown regression guard.
  - `test/test_resolver.js` — 16-assertion Node test for `assets/js/obsidian-wiki-links.js` using a hand-rolled DOM shim; exercises wiki-link resolution, embeds, tags, and DOM-level callout rewriting.
  - `test/test_obsidian.sh` — orchestrator that runs both unit suites and validates that the Jekyll build emits a well-formed `wiki-index.json`. Wired into `test/test_runner.sh`.
  - `test/fixtures/obsidian/sample-note.md` — representative Obsidian note exercising every supported feature.
- **Obsidian Graph View** — Live, force-directed knowledge graph at `/docs/obsidian/graph/` mirroring Obsidian's local graph view. Built from the same `assets/data/wiki-index.json` that powers the resolver and backlinks panel.
  - `pages/_docs/obsidian/graph.md` — graph page (Bootstrap toolbar with title filter, "Show orphans" switch, "Reset view" button; collection-color legend; usage tips). Cytoscape.js loaded only on this page via CDN with SRI + `crossorigin="anonymous"`.
  - `assets/js/obsidian-graph.js` — vanilla-JS renderer (~330 lines, no build step). Mirrors the resolver's normalization (`toLowerCase().trim()` + whitespace collapse) so wiki-index keys match. `cose` force layout, hover-highlight neighborhood, click-to-navigate (⌘/Ctrl-click for new tab), search-driven node fading, orphans hidden by default with a Bootstrap switch toggle. Broken targets render as dashed red nodes prefixed `__broken__:` in the graph model.
  - `assets/data/wiki-index.json` — extended each entry with an `outgoing: [...]` array of normalized wiki-link targets, extracted at build time via Liquid (masks `![[…]]` embeds, splits on `[[`/`]]`/`|`/`#`/`^`, downcases, dedupes).
- **Docs**: `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` updated with an Obsidian vault section pointing to the new docs.
- **Bare-minimum 3-file remote-theme starter.** Consumers can now publish a
  fully styled site to GitHub Pages with only `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, and
  `index.md` — no installer required. The new `_layouts/welcome.html` shipped
  by the theme detects unconfigured sites and renders an onboarding screen
  with a hero checklist, a 3-step starter accordion, and the embedded
  `_includes/setup/wizard.html` that generates a personalised `_config.yml`
  on the fly. README gained a "Bare-Minimum Starter" section documenting the
  pattern.
- **Smarter setup detection** in `_includes/components/setup-check.html`.
  When `site_configured` is not set, the heuristic now flags a site as
  unconfigured if it has no owner (`founder`/`author`/`email`) or its title
  matches a known placeholder (`zer0-mistakes`, `zer0-pages-remote`,
  `Your Site Title`, `My Awesome Site`, `Welcome`, `Untitled`, or empty).

### Fixed
- **Preview Image Generator**: Fixed `scripts/features/generate-preview-images`
  project-root detection when invoked through the wrapper and added support for
  OpenAI GPT image generation responses that return `b64_json` instead of URL
  downloads. The generator now reports the active image model and defaults to
  `gpt-image-2` with GPT-image-friendly size and quality settings.
- **Obsidian Local Graph**: Moved the local graph out of the documentation
  navigation sidebar into its own collapsible side panel with a larger canvas
  and resize-on-open behavior so Cytoscape renders cleanly. Pages with no
  local wiki-link neighbors now keep the graph control visible and render a
  current-page-only graph instead of hiding the panel.
- **Obsidian Resolver**: The client-side wiki-link resolver now receives
  baseurl-safe index, attachment, and tag URLs from Liquid and derives a safe
  fallback from its script path for GitHub Pages project sites.
- **Backlinks**: The linked-mentions include now skips draft and unpublished
  candidates unless `site.show_drafts` is enabled.
- **Validation**: `scripts/bin/validate --quick` now accepts YAML anchors and
  date values used by repository config/data files.
- **Tests**: `test/test_runner.sh` now includes an `obsidian` suite key/name so
  suite keys, scripts, and labels stay aligned.
- **Footer Quick Links no longer 404 on bare-minimum sites.**
  `_includes/core/footer.html` previously hard-coded links to
  `/about/`, `/services/`, `/news/`, `/contact/`, `/privacy-policy`, and
  `/terms-of-service` — none of which exist in a 3-file remote-theme
  consumer. Quick Links are now resolved in this order:
  1. `site.footer_quick_links` (array of `{label, url}`) — explicit override
  2. Auto-detection: each candidate link only renders if the target page
     exists in `site.html_pages`
  3. Fallback to `Home` + `Sitemap (XML)` only.
  Privacy Policy / Terms of Service links use the same existence check and
  optionally read from `site.privacy_policy_url` / `site.terms_of_service_url`.
- **Welcome layout external links now point to existing README anchors.**
  The "Next steps" cards in `_layouts/welcome.html` linked to
  `#content-creation` and `#customisation`, which don't exist in the theme
  README. They now point to `README.md#-quick-start` and
  `README.md#-key-features` respectively.
- **Theme info admin links are conditional.**
  `_includes/components/info-section.html` previously rendered Admin
  Dashboard links to `/about/config/`, `/about/settings/theme/`,
  `/about/settings/navigation/`, and `/about/settings/environment/`
  unconditionally — guaranteed 404s on bare-minimum sites. The links and
  surrounding section now only render when the corresponding page exists.
- **Source Code shortcuts skip GitHub buttons when repository is unknown.**
  `_includes/components/dev-shortcuts.html` rendered `https://github.com//blob//`
  URLs when `site.repository` and `site.branch` were empty (typical on bare
  consumer sites). It now hides the GitHub-based buttons and shows a hint
  to set `repository: USER/REPO` in `_config.yml`.
- **Cookie-consent privacy link is conditional.** The "Learn more in our
  Privacy Policy" anchor in `_includes/components/cookie-consent.html` only
  renders if a `/privacy-policy/` page exists or `site.privacy_policy_url` is
  configured.
- **Setup banner link.** `_includes/components/setup-banner.html` no longer
  points at the non-existent `/404.html`; it now links to
  `/#setup-wizard`, which is provided by the new welcome layout.
- **Version-bump workflow no longer crashes on bash 5.x runners.** `scripts/utils/analyze-commits` (and `scripts/lib/changelog.sh`, `scripts/lib/migrate.sh`) used the `((var++))` post-increment idiom. On bash 5.x, when `var` is 0 the expression evaluates to 0 → exit code 1 → `set -euo pipefail` terminates the script silently. macOS bash 3.2 was more forgiving, so the bug only surfaced in CI. Replaced all release-path sites with `var=$((var + 1))`, which always returns 0. Added a static regression check to the unit tests so the pattern can't return.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

First stable major release. Consolidates the breaking-change installer rewrite
(shipped in error as v0.22.22 due to a silent bug in the version analyzer) and
the fix that restored the release automation.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **Modular installer.** The 2,400-line monolithic `install.sh` is decomposed into a CLI dispatcher (`scripts/bin/install`) backed by focused library modules (`scripts/lib/install/*.sh`) and declarative YAML profiles (`templates/profiles/*.yml`). The legacy `curl | bash` one-liner still works — it bootstraps the same pipeline.
- **Legacy mode flags deprecated.** `--full`, `--minimal`, `--fork`, `--remote`, `--github` continue to work in 1.0.x with a one-line deprecation warning. They map 1:1 to `install init --profile <name>`. Targeted removal: 2.0.
- **`--azure` flag removed.** Replaced by `install deploy azure-swa`. Old flag emits a clear error pointing at the new command.
- **Templates are the single source of truth.** Embedded heredoc fallbacks in `install.sh` are gone. A stripped distribution (theme tarball without `templates/`) will fail; the bootstrap downloads the templates tarball alongside `install.sh` for `curl | bash`.

See [`docs/installation/migration-from-0.x.md`](docs/installation/migration-from-0.x.md) for the full flag-by-flag mapping.

### Added

#### Modular installer (Phases 1-7 of the refactor)

- **`scripts/bin/install`** — canonical CLI with subcommands: `init`, `wizard [--ai]`, `agents`, `deploy`, `doctor [--ai] [--quiet] [--json]`, `diagnose [--ai]`, `upgrade`, `list-profiles`, `list-targets`, `version`, `help`.
- **`scripts/lib/install/`** — focused modules: `core`, `platform`, `template`, `fs`, `config`, `pages`, `profile`, `wizard_interactive`, `doctor`, `upgrade`, `agents`, `ai/{openai,wizard,diagnose,suggest}`, `deploy/{registry,github-pages,azure-swa,docker-prod}`. All bash 3.2 compatible.
- **`templates/profiles/*.yml`** — declarative profile manifests (`full`, `minimal`, `fork`, `remote`, `github`).
- **`templates/deploy/<target>/`** — pluggable deploy templates (workflow YAMLs, Dockerfile, nginx.conf).
- **`templates/agents/`** — distributable AI agent guidance (CLAUDE.md, aider.conf.yml templates).
- **`templates/ai/prompts/`** — system prompts for AI subcommands.
- **`.zer0-installed` marker file** — tracks installed theme version for idempotent `install upgrade`.
- **AI integration (opt-in, sandboxed):** `install wizard --ai` (OpenAI-backed `_config.yml` generation), `install diagnose --ai` (unified-diff patch proposals), `install deploy --ai-suggest` (deploy-target recommendation). Honors `ZER0_NO_AI=1` kill switch. All payloads sanitized; all writes diffed before confirmation.
- **`install doctor`** — platform/tooling/site/AI health check with PASS/WARN/FAIL counters, `--quiet` and `--json` modes. Used as preflight in `install init` (opt out with `--skip-doctor`).
- **`install upgrade`** — idempotent in-place upgrade tracked via `.zer0-installed`. `--from`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--auto-accept`. Refreshes agents and checks deploy-workflow drift.
- **`docs/installation/`** — full doc tree: `index`, `architecture`, `profiles`, `deploy-targets`, `ai-features`, `migration-from-0.x`, `customization`.
- **`.github/instructions/install.instructions.md`** — agent guidance for installer code.
- **`.github/workflows/doctor.yml`** — CI matrix (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest) running `install doctor --json` on every push/PR touching installer code.
- **`.github/workflows/install-matrix.yml`** — full installer e2e matrix (ubuntu-latest + macos-latest × ruby 2.7/3.0/3.2) plus a `curl|bash` bootstrap smoke job.
- **Installer e2e suites** under `test/`: `test_install_profiles.sh`, `test_install_deploy.sh`, `test_install_ai_mock.sh`, `test_install_legacy_flags.sh`, `test_install_idempotency.sh`.
- **`scripts/bin/test install`** — new test-suite group that executes all installer e2e tests.

#### Versioning & release automation (new in 1.0.0)

- New unit-test file `scripts/test/lib/test_analyze_commits.sh` (15 assertions) covering: scoped conventional types, `!` breaking-change marker, `BREAKING CHANGE` / `BREAKING-CHANGE` footers, and stdout/stderr separation. Wired into `scripts/test/lib/run_tests.sh`.

### Fixed

- **Versioning automation no longer silently swallows analyzer crashes.** `scripts/utils/analyze-commits` called `log_info` / `log_warning` / `log_debug` / `log_error` helpers that were never defined in `scripts/lib/common.sh`, causing the script to exit 127 with empty stdout. The version-bump workflow then fell back to `patch` via `2>/dev/null || echo "patch"`, which is exactly what shipped v0.22.22 instead of the intended v1.0.0 for the breaking-change installer rewrite (PR #76). The analyzer now defines stderr-only logging helpers, and the workflow refuses to publish on analyzer failure or invalid output.
- **Conventional Commits `!` breaking-change marker is now recognised.** `feat!:`, `fix(scope)!:`, and `refactor(api)!:` correctly trigger a major bump in both the version analyzer and changelog categoriser. Previously only the long-form `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer was detected.
- **Scoped types are recognised everywhere.** `feat(auth):`, `fix(api):`, `chore(deps):`, etc. are now properly classified by `analyze-commits` and grouped correctly in `changelog.sh`.
- `install.sh` — `gh_args[@]: unbound variable` crash when invoking the github profile with no fork environment variables set (`set -u` + empty array). Guarded with `${gh_args[@]+"${gh_args[@]}"}`.

### Changed

- `scripts/utils/analyze-commits` now guarantees that **only** the bump type (`patch|minor|major|none`) is written to stdout. All progress and debug output is sent to stderr, so callers can safely use `BUMP=$(./analyze-commits ...)`.
- `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` streams the analyzer's stderr into a collapsible job-log group and validates the returned bump type, failing the run with an annotated error if the analyzer crashes or returns garbage.
- `README.md` Installation Methods section now references the modular CLI alongside the legacy one-liner.
- `docs/FORKING.md` includes an `install init --profile fork` flow alongside the standalone `fork-cleanup.sh` script.
- `AGENTS.md` instruction map adds the new install instructions row.

### Changed
- Version bump: patch release

### Commits in this release
- 7f00e4d docs(roadmap): data-driven roadmap with auto-generated README mermaid diagram (#71)

### Changed
- **Copilot Agent prompts (`_data/prompts.yml`)**: rewritten to focus on
  frontend/CMS workflows for the Jekyll theme. Replaced the previous
  general-purpose software-engineering templates with 10 prompts split into
  two scopes: **Page Improvements** (`improve-page`, `expand-page`,
  `update-page`, `fix-page`, `seo-optimize`, `accessibility-audit`) that act
  on the current page, and **Site Improvements** (`ui-ux-improvement`,
  `new-feature`, `component-enhancement`, `performance-optimization`) for
  theme-wide changes. Every prompt explicitly references the auto-injected
  Page Context table.
- **Intro component (`_includes/content/intro.html`)**: the Copilot Agent
  dropdown now renders Bootstrap `dropdown-header` section labels and
  dividers when prompt entries declare a `group`. Entries without a
  `group` continue to render as plain items (backward compatible).
- **Docs (`docs/implementation/copilot-agent-prompt-button.md`)**: updated
  the prompt registry table and YAML schema to document the new `group`
  field and the new template set.

### Added
- **Roadmap data file**: `_data/roadmap.yml` is now the single source of truth for the project roadmap (versions, status, dates, targets, and feature highlights).
- **Roadmap generator**: `scripts/generate-roadmap.rb` (and shell wrapper `scripts/generate-roadmap.sh`) renders a Mermaid gantt diagram and summary table from `_data/roadmap.yml` and injects them into `README.md` between `<!-- ROADMAP_MERMAID:START/END -->` and `<!-- ROADMAP_TABLE:START/END -->` markers. Supports `--check` mode for CI drift detection and `--stdout` for previewing.
- **Roadmap sync workflow**: `.github/workflows/roadmap-sync.yml` regenerates the README on push to `main` when the data file or generator changes, and verifies sync on PRs that touch those files.
- **Local Graph Sidebar Widget** — Per-page mini Obsidian-style local graph rendered at the top of the left sidebar on every page that has one.
  - `_includes/navigation/local-graph.html` — small widget with a "Local graph" heading, a "full ›" link to `/docs/obsidian/graph/`, and a `#obsidian-local-graph` container. Honors `local_graph: false` and `local_graph_depth: N` (default 1) in page front matter.
  - `assets/js/obsidian-local-graph.js` — fetches `wiki-index.json`, finds the current page by `window.location.pathname` (with title/basename fallback), BFS through both outgoing and incoming wiki-links to the configured depth, renders the subgraph with cytoscape.js (`cose` layout sized for ~220px sidebar canvas). Highlights the current page with an orange border + larger node + bold label. Click navigates (⌘/Ctrl-click opens new tab). Hides itself silently if the page isn't in the wiki-index or has no neighbors. Cytoscape is lazy-loaded from CDN with SRI + `crossorigin="anonymous"` and de-duplicated against the full graph page's existing load.
  - `_includes/navigation/sidebar-left.html` — includes the new widget at the top of `.offcanvas-body`, before the nav-mode chain.
  - `_sass/core/_obsidian.scss` — added `.obsidian-local-graph-widget` styles for the 220px container with theme-aware borders/background.
- **Docs**: `docs/FORKING.md` — progressive fork → configure → personalize workflow for the `username.github.io` user-site pattern
- **Tests**: `test/test_fork_cleanup.sh` — 32-assertion suite covering CLI parsing, dry-run, real cleanup, YAML anchor preservation, and idempotency

### Changed
- **Obsidian docs**: `pages/_docs/obsidian/syntax-reference.md` — graph view now marked **Available** (was "Not yet implemented"); `pages/_docs/obsidian/index.md` — added Graph view row to the section table.
- **Documentation cross-linking**: appended a `## See also` block of `[[wiki-links]]` to every page in `pages/_docs/` (76 files — section indexes, leaf pages, and the obsidian cluster) so the graph view shows real cluster structure. Edge count grew from 12 → 292 with 90+ visible nodes after orphan filtering.
- **Obsidian Graph View polish**: removed the white pill backgrounds behind labels (now halo-only outlines that match the canvas color, so edges read through cleanly); labels hide by default and reveal on zoom-in or hover, while the 37 hub nodes (degree ≥ 6 — Docker, Front Matter, Jeykll, Layouts, Customization, Release Management, etc.) keep their labels always-on as landmarks; loosened `cose` layout (`nodeRepulsion` 8000→18000, `idealEdgeLength` 80→130, added `nodeOverlap: 24` and `componentSpacing: 80`, dropped gravity 0.25→0.18, `numIter` 2500); taller canvas (`82vh` / `620px` min, was `75vh` / `520px`); bigger `cy.fit()` padding (40→70 default, 80→100 for search matches) so top-row labels don't clip the canvas edge.
- **README roadmap section** is now auto-generated from `_data/roadmap.yml` instead of being hand-maintained, and includes status, target, and detailed highlight columns.
- **`pages/roadmap.md`** rewritten to render the Mermaid gantt chart, release summary, and per-version detail sections directly from `_data/roadmap.yml` via Liquid — so the Jekyll page is always live with the canonical data.
- **`_data/README.md`** documents the new `roadmap.yml` data file.
- **Landing page**: `_includes/landing/landing-install-cards.html` — “Fork & Deploy” card now guides users to fork into `<username>.github.io` and run `scripts/fork-cleanup.sh`; safer `github_fork` URL handling
- **README**: `README.md` — Method 3 (Fork & Customize) reframed as “Fork & Deploy as Your Site” with a 4-step path; deployment section updated for user-site flow
- **Docs**: `pages/_quickstart/github-setup.md`, `pages/_quickstart/index.md`, `pages/_docs/getting-started/quick-start.md`, `pages/_docs/deployment/github-pages.md`, `docs/configuration/url-configuration-guide.md` — aligned with the user-site fork pattern (`baseurl: ""`)
- **Templates**: `templates/cleanup/reset-fields.yml` — annotated `baseurl` reasoning; clarified user-site vs. project-site behavior
- **Templates**: `templates/config/install.conf` — minor consistency tweaks

### Fixed
- **Fork cleanup**: `scripts/fork-cleanup.sh` — `get_reset_field_value()` now uses `YAML.safe_load_file(..., aliases: true)` so anchors in `reset-fields.yml` no longer break parsing under newer Ruby
- **Fork cleanup**: `scripts/fork-cleanup.sh` — repository name derivation now strips `.git` suffix and falls back gracefully when `origin` is missing (no `set -euo pipefail` aborts)
- **Fork cleanup**: `scripts/fork-cleanup.sh` — `posthog`/`giscus` blocks reset only within their own YAML range (no stray matches in unrelated blocks)
- **Welcome post**: `templates/pages/welcome-post.md.template` and embedded fallback in `scripts/fork-cleanup.sh` — corrected `layout: journals` → `layout: article` so the generated welcome post builds without “Layout does not exist” warnings on a freshly cleaned fork

### Commits in this release
- 3c96620 feat: vendor assets, theme architecture, CI and docs (v0.21.3) (#39)


## [0.21.3] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- **Test runner**: When `test.conf` sets a non-default `TEST_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`, pass `--timeout` only to suites whose scripts accept it (`core`, `deployment`, `quality`). Avoids `Unknown option: --timeout` on installation and site-generation suites.
- **Vendor assets (GitHub Pages)**: Bootstrap, jQuery, Bootstrap Icons, MathJax, Mermaid, Font Awesome, and GitHub Calendar load from committed `assets/vendor/` with `relative_url` (no runtime CDN for core assets). Added `vendor-manifest.json`, `scripts/vendor-install.sh`, and `npm run vendor:install`. `.gitignore` uses `/vendor/` for Bundler only; removed blanket `vendor/` from Jekyll `exclude` so `assets/vendor/` is published. Docker base image includes `jq` for vendor installs; `scripts/bin/build` runs vendor-install before gem build.
- **Mermaid vendor source**: `mermaid` is a devDependency; `npm run vendor:mermaid` copies `node_modules/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js` into `assets/vendor/mermaid/`. The jsDelivr Mermaid entry was removed from `vendor-manifest.json`; `vendor-install.sh` copies from npm when `node_modules` is present.
- Version bump: patch release
- **CSS architecture**: Removed unused `assets/css/custom.css` (legacy `#mainNav`); overrides use `_sass/custom.scss` or optional `user-overrides.css`. Replaced vendored `_sass/core/_docs.scss` (~3.2k lines) with trimmed `_sass/core/_docs-layout.scss`. Theme modes: `_sass/theme/_color-modes.scss` re-exports `_wizard-mode.scss` (wizard Sass/CSS) and `_css-variables.scss` (`--bd-*` tokens); dropped duplicate blocks from `_theme.scss`, duplicate Bootstrap font/line-height block in `_variables.scss`, and unused social/base16 duplicates from `_variables.scss`. Feature metadata now points styles at `_docs-layout.scss`.
- **Optional npm Bootstrap**: Added `package.json` with `npm run css:bootstrap` (Dart Sass + Bootstrap 5.3.3) producing `assets/css/vendor/bootstrap-from-npm.css`; documented alternate `<link>` in `_includes/core/head.html`. `stats.css` remains a conditional stylesheet for the stats layout only.
