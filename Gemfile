# Gemfile — year-of-ai.github.io (remote_theme consumer)
# =============================================================================
# This site vendors no theme files; it renders via the zer0-mistakes theme
# pulled over `remote_theme` (see _config.yml). Production builds on native
# GitHub Pages, which ignores this file and uses its own github-pages gem set —
# this Gemfile is only for local builds/previews, kept in lockstep with Pages.

# `jekyll preview-images` — the fleet's AI preview-banner engine (same pin as
# lifehacker.dev and the ai-world-view hub). Build-time only: GitHub Pages
# ignores it (safe mode) and serves the committed images. The grow tick
# (grow-lineage.yml "Illustrate" step) installs it on the runner to banner the
# member repos; scripts/generate-preview-images.sh resolves the engine from
# this gem for the hub's own pages.
