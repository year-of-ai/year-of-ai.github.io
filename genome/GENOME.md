# GENOME — the DNA of the whole organizational model

This directory is the **genome**: the abstracted, concept-agnostic DNA of the
entire `year-of-ai` model — its architecture, workflows, scripts, framework,
policy, templates, and self-improvement design — packaged so the *whole machine*
can be **replanted in a new GitHub org for a new concept** (countries, chemical
elements, philosophers, …) by filling one small manifest, **without reinventing
the wheel**. And it is kept honest by a routine-sync gate so it can't rot into a
stale snapshot.

> The per-member `lineage/seeds/<id>.md` is the DNA of *one knowledge base*.
> **This genome is the DNA of the organization that grows them.**

## 1 · The concept delta — one manifest

Everything concept-specific is isolated into a single human-filled file,
[`genome.yml`](genome.yml) (validated by [`schema.json`](schema.json)). To plant
the model for a new concept you change ~9 required fields; everything else
transplants unchanged. See [`genome.example.countries.yml`](genome.example.countries.yml)
for a complete *"countries"* fill — the proof that the model carries DNA, not
instance.

| Block | What it sets (examples: `year-of-ai` → `countries`) |
|---|---|
| `identity` | org, hub repo/domain, theme repo, bot email — `year-of-ai` → `world-atlas` |
| `branding` | site title/tagline, founder, preview-image style, chat assistant — `Year of AI` → `World Atlas` |
| `lexicon` | what one member is called + how an id becomes its subject — `the year {member}` → `the country {member}` |
| `taxonomy` | strategy (`temporal`/`enumerable`/`hierarchical`) + the 4–8 default categories |
| `lifecycle` | the first member, the slug rule, the succession rule, consolidation naming |
| `cadence` | growth cron + replant/consolidate thresholds |
| `growth` | `web_sources: false` → the org generates from the model's **own knowledge**, no web (plant strips `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` + flags the prompt) — e.g. `ai-world-view` (the AI's *own* world view) |
| `analytics`/`social`/`comments` | owner-specific ids — **default empty; never inherited** |

## 2 · What the genome contains — the 4-tier transplant map

Every concept-bearing asset of the model is classified in
[`manifest.yml`](manifest.yml). Four tiers:

- **`transplant`** — concept-**agnostic**, copied byte-for-byte. The whole agent
  framework (`lineage/framework/**` skills/prompts/agents), the hub scripts
  (`lib/hub.rb`, `sync-*`, `content-review`, `docs-warden`, and the fleet's
  `normalize-front-matter-dates` publish-gate/repair tool and
  `sync-member-metadata` registry→GitHub-metadata sync), the `.claude` adapter
  set, the theme-data files, the chat-proxy worker, the legal pages. *Must
  contain no concept literal* (the verify gate enforces this).
- **`template`** — carries concept literals, tokenized via the `tokens:`
  literal→`{{TOKEN}}` map at plant time: `_config.yml`, `_data/hub.yml`,
  `policy.yml`, the orchestration/grow workflows, the provisioner + planter.
- **`override`** — a templated copy that overlays an otherwise-agnostic file
  (e.g. the repo-template `CLAUDE.md`, and the four framework files that carry the
  bot email or hub name).
- **`regenerate`** — concept *narrative* re-authored for the new concept by a
  genesis agent, not gsub'd (the hub's `pages/*.md`, the org profile README at
  `templates/org-profile/`, and per-member seeds — a blind find/replace would
  mangle SVG labels and prose).

Anything not in a tier is `ignore`d (instance content, generated data, build
output, binaries — including this repo's own top-level docs: `README.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).

A **default plant lands a clean, minimal growing org** — only the growth engine
(`orchestrate` + `grow-lineage` + `hub-sync`) and the site. The mature
self-improvement fleet (monitors, reviewers, `genome-sync`, …) is listed in
`manifest.yml`'s `default_plant_exclude` and added with `plant.rb --with-fleet`
once the org has the context those workflows need (a populated ledger, members,
PRs). plant.rb also **authors a starter `pages/home.md`** from the manifest so
every plant has a live homepage, and honors `growth.web_sources: false` for a
no-web org.

## 3 · Plant runbook — standing up a new org

The two **irreducibly human** steps are one-time: **(a)** create the GitHub org
(no API), and **(b)** mint + set the three secrets (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LIFECYCLE_PAT` — sensitive credentials only a human can
mint; `gh secret set` can upload but not create them). Everything else is
automatable by the planter (`bin/plant.rb`, staged — see §5):

1. **(human)** Create the org `world-atlas`.
2. Fill `genome.yml` for the concept (human *intent*, ~9 fields — draftable by a
   genesis-org prompt).
3. Render: copy `transplant/` + `org-site/` verbatim, render `template/` +
   `override/` through the manifest, into a fresh hub-repo tree. *(render raises on
   any unresolved `{{TOKEN}}` — the completeness gate.)*
4. Create `world-atlas/world-atlas.github.io`, push, enable Pages (reuses
   `provision-org-sites.rb`).
5. **(human)** Set the three org secrets.
6. Write `lineage/seeds/<first_member>.md` from the manifest, refresh the ledger,
   and plant + grow the first member (reuses `plant-lineage.rb` + the grow tick).
7. Regenerate the hub narrative pages for the concept; the daily orchestrate cron
   takes over — the new org now grows, spawns, and self-improves on its own.

## 4 · Routine sync — the genome cannot rot

A bootstrap kit that drifts from reality is worse than none. The genome is kept
truthful by [`bin/verify.rb`](bin/verify.rb), wired into CI
(`.github/workflows/genome-sync.yml`) so a model change that isn't reflected in
the genome turns the build **red**:

- **drift gate** — every tracked file is classified by `manifest.yml`; a file that
  is neither classified nor ignored *and carries a concept literal* fails: *"the
  model grew a limb the genome doesn't track."*
- **leak gate** — every `transplant:` file must be concept-agnostic; a literal
  hiding in a "verbatim" file fails.

```
$ ruby genome/bin/verify.rb
  ✓ genome in sync: every concept-bearing tracked file is classified, no leaks.
```

Future (staged): a `genome-sync` agent in the [self-improvement fleet](../lineage/decisions/ADR-0003-self-improving-agent-fleet.md)
that doesn't just *detect* drift but *re-abstracts* the change into the genome and
opens a PR.

## 5 · Status — what's built vs staged

**Built now:** the abstraction contract — `genome.yml` + `schema.json` +
`genome.example.countries.yml` (the *countries* proof) + `manifest.yml` (the
4-tier inventory) + `bin/verify.rb` (the routine-sync gate, green against the live
repo) + the `genome-sync` CI workflow + [`bin/render.rb`](bin/render.rb) (the
token-substitution engine — derives the full `{{TOKEN}}` map from `genome.yml`,
raises on any unresolved token; `--selftest` renders one template to both the
`year-of-ai` and `countries` values, proving the abstraction).

[`bin/plant.rb`](bin/plant.rb) **(dry-run)** assembles a complete, rendered hub
tree for any concept by reading the live repo per `manifest.yml` (transplant
copied, template/override transformed via `render.rb`'s token map) into
`./_planted/<org>/`, with a leak report. Verified for *countries*: `_config.yml`,
`_data/hub.yml`, and the growth workflows all correctly become `world-atlas` /
`World Atlas` / `bot@world-atlas.org` — **zero residual structural source
literals**. Bare unit-noun substitution is deliberately avoided (it would corrupt
Jekyll date config like `:year` / `year-month-day`); the unit-noun is handled via
curated exact phrases (`manifest.yml`'s `phrase_tokens:` — now also covering
`every {unit}`, `{unit}'s`, `{unit}-repo`, and the `<{unit}>` bracket-placeholder
form found by the `ai-world-view` plant), the instance member list is pruned
(members self-register), and Jekyll date placeholders are preserved. `cr_year`
(`_config.yml`) and the `LICENSE` copyright line are handled by their own
exact-scoped substitution pairs (a bare 4-digit `gsub` would corrupt unrelated
numbers) — both are now classified in `manifest.yml` (`LICENSE` as `override`,
`.gitignore`/`search.json` as `transplant`) so a plant carries them automatically
instead of silently dropping them. `CHAT_ASSISTANT_NAME` is substitution-guarded
against colliding with the `zer0-mistakes` theme's own brand name (a bare
`"Zer0"` is a substring of `"Zer0-Mistakes"`; an unguarded gsub renamed the
theme itself in `_data/authors.yml` and the chat-proxy wrangler template on the
first real plant). The only remaining residue is a handful of **cosmetic**
`year` mentions in workflow *comments* and doc placeholders (e.g.
`lineage/seeds/<year>.md`) — no config value or behavior; the narrative pages are
in the `regenerate` tier. Running plant from the canonical hub means **no
duplicate payload is committed** — the live repo is the source, so the genome
can't drift from a stale copy.

`plant.rb --apply --confirm <org>` is **built**: with the two-key confirm + a
membership guard (refuses any account you can't create repos in), it authors
member #1's seed from the manifest, `gh repo create`s the hub, pushes the
assembled tree, and enables Pages. The **two irreducibly-human steps remain**:
creating the GitHub org (no API exists) and minting + setting the three secrets.
Once those are done, one `--apply` stands up the live, growing new-concept org.

**Staged (next):** the genesis branch that gives member #1 its seed §2–7 from a
first grow tick.
