# ADR-0006 — Operational hardening & growth cadence

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-07-06
- **Context**: Full review of the hub and the 11-member fleet (three parallel
  audits: purpose surfaces, hub machinery, org-wide health), triggered by the
  first real fleet outages.

## What the review found

1. **A member site was down for six days behind green dashboards.** The
   2026-06-30 grow tick wrote `date: "1777–1778"` (an en-dash range) into a
   1777 front matter; Jekyll's datetime parse fails the *whole* site build.
   The site served 06-29 content until 07-06. Nothing escalated: grow runs
   conclude `success` on no-op ticks, and the Pages Deploy Sentinel's
   cross-repo build check was silently inert (the hub-scoped `github.token`
   cannot read other repos' Pages builds; the error was masked to a
   healthy-looking `no-pages`) — so its HTTP-200 check passed against the
   stale-but-live site.
2. **Platform-side deploy flakes don't recover on their own.** 2008 and 2012
   had `actions/deploy-pages` failures ("Deployment failed, try again later")
   that latched for days; several other members had one-off flakes that
   happened to self-recover.
3. **Security gaps in the tick.** `actions/checkout` persisted the org-wide
   `LIFECYCLE_PAT` into `.git/config` while three model passes ran with
   `Bash + WebFetch/WebSearch` over researched web content (a prompt-injection
   exfiltration path); `${{ inputs.repo }}` was interpolated raw into `run:`
   blocks.
4. **Broken fallback gate.** The API-key fallback's "tick produced nothing"
   check counted the always-present staged files, so `empty` was always false
   — a silent all-tier no-op never fell back.
5. **Kill-switch gaps.** `grow-lineage.yml` (the actual writer) never read
   `_data/fleet_pause.yml`; nor did `hub-sync.yml`'s commit.
6. **Cost had no governor.** Every member grew every day (11 × 3-tier passes;
   telemetry records ~$3.4–4.8 for the *final pass alone* per tick), and
   `policy.yml`'s `cadence:` block was consumed by nothing.
7. **Theme = single external point of failure.** All 12 sites built against
   `bamr87/zer0-mistakes` at floating HEAD, a theme that ships several
   releases a week.
8. **Contradictory dead weight staged into every tick**: the old peer-to-peer
   `framework/workflows/{grow,learn,telemetry}.yml`, `scripts/lineage.sh`, and
   the consolidate/replant/genesis prompts + check-lifecycle skill (all
   forbidden by `policy.yml`'s perpetual-growth doctrine).

## Decisions

1. **Publish gate for front matter** — `scripts/normalize-front-matter-dates.rb`
   deterministically normalizes `date:` values (range → start date, bare year →
   `YYYY-01-01`, prose → ISO) and the grow tick refuses to publish anything
   still unparseable. The same script is the one-shot repair tool for existing
   member content.
2. **Sentinel measures builds, not just liveness** — it now uses
   `LIFECYCLE_PAT` for the cross-repo Pages-builds API, treats `errored`,
   `stuck-building` (>90 min) and `unreadable` as unhealthy, and auto-closes
   its sticky issue on recovery (matching its sibling watchers).
3. **Tick hardening** — a `gate` job (kill-switch + input validation) fronts
   `grow-lineage.yml` so even `if: always()` steps cannot run when paused;
   `persist-credentials: false` keeps the PAT out of the model passes' reach;
   the fallback gate counts only real content changes and checks `is_error`
   on every tier, not just the last.
4. **Policy-driven cadence** — `cadence.repos_per_run` (default **4**) with
   stalest-first selection in `orchestrate.yml`. Every member still grows
   perpetually; each now ticks roughly every 3 days instead of daily, cutting
   model spend ~2/3. Set `repos_per_run: 0` to restore grow-everything-daily.
5. **Theme pinning** — `remote_theme` is pinned to a tagged release in the
   hub's `_config.yml` and in `_data/hub.yml` (`pages.theme_repo`, which the
   provisioner templates into member configs). Theme bumps become deliberate:
   update both, then re-roll members with `provision-org-sites.rb`.
6. **Staging trim** — the dead peer-to-peer surfaces are no longer staged into
   ticks (excluded in the staging step). The files stay in
   `lineage/framework/` as reference until a future cleanup removes them.
7. **Hub-main push discipline** — every hub-`main` pusher
   (seed persist, telemetry ledger, orchestrate's ledger commit, hub-sync)
   retries with rebase; hub-sync also honors the kill-switch.

## Consequences

- Slower per-member growth by design (a policy knob, not a code change, to
  revert).
- Theme fixes no longer arrive automatically — bumping the pin is a deliberate,
  reviewable act.
- The old lifecycle surfaces remain on disk but out of ticks; removing them
  entirely (and pruning the matching member `.claude` adapter commands) is
  follow-up work.
- Known residual risks, accepted for now: the seed §8 clock is persisted
  before the content publish (a failed publish can advance the clock); seeds
  grow unboundedly and are staged whole into every pass (trimming staged §8
  history needs a merge-aware persist step first).
