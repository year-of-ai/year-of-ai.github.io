# ADR-0001: Centralized growth orchestration in the hub

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Deciders:** Repo owner (@bamr87)

## Context

The `year-of-ai` org is a set of **self-growing knowledge bases** — one repo per
year (`1776`, `1777`, `1778`, `2005`–`2011`, …). Each researches and writes its
own encyclopedic content one daily *tick* at a time, and each publishes its own
GitHub Pages site.

The original model was **per-repo orchestration**: every year repo carried its
own copy of the full growth toolkit — `grow.yml` (a daily cron), `lifecycle.yml`
(policy + state machine), `seed.md` (concept + Evolution Log), and the complete
`.github/` + `.claude/` agent framework (skills, prompts, agents, scripts). A
"driver" repo forward-pollinated framework changes to the others peer-to-peer via
`lineage.sh`.

Forces at play:
- **Drift & duplication.** N copies of the framework drifted; pollination was a
  cost center (telemetry: ~73% of turns / 62% of cost went to the shepherd path
  re-improvising git plumbing).
- **Scattered scheduling.** N crons, no single throttle or kill-switch.
- **Owner intent.** "The seed should live in the main hub repo, which also links
  to each individual year's Pages. Year repos should hold **only** the content, a
  GitHub Pages config, claude files, and telemetry." → centralize; keep year
  repos lean.
- **Cost shape.** Content generation is the expensive part and should run on a
  controlled cadence with model-tier escalation, not be re-paid per repo for
  mechanical framework upkeep.

## Decision

**Centralize all growth orchestration in the hub** (`year-of-ai.github.io`). The
hub owns *what grows, how, and when*; year repos own *only their content + Pages*.

Hub holds:
- `lineage/seeds/<year>.md` — each year's concept (§1) + Evolution Log (§8, the
  tick clock).
- `lineage/policy.yml` — model tiers + cadence + auth contract.
- `lineage/framework/` — the **canonical** agent toolkit (Copilot layout:
  `prompts/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `instructions/`, `scripts/`, `workflows/`).
- `.github/workflows/orchestrate.yml` — daily scheduler (refresh ledger →
  dispatch a grow tick per repo).
- `.github/workflows/grow-lineage.yml` — the growth engine (grows one repo/run).

Year repos hold: content + `_config.yml` + `.claude/` (**thin adapters**) +
`telemetry/` + `CLAUDE.md` + `.gitignore`. No `seed.md`, `lifecycle.yml`,
`.github/`, or per-repo cron.

A tick: hub checks out the target year repo → stages `lineage/framework/* →
.github/` and `lineage/seeds/<repo>.md → seed.md` → runs the 3-tier escalation
(`claude-haiku-4-5` draft → `claude-sonnet-4-6` expand → `claude-opus-4-8`
enhance; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fallback pass on empty-tree/`is_error`) → persists
seed §8 back to the hub → strips hub-owned files → publishes **only** content +
telemetry to the year repo.

### The framework mechanism — adapter + staging (the subtle part)

Year repos keep only **thin Claude-Code adapters** in `.claude/`
(`.claude/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` ≈ 20 lines: *"canonical procedure:
`.github/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` — read it and follow exactly"*; commands/agents
likewise point to `.github/prompts/*` and `.github/agents/*`). The `claude` CLI
**discovers** the adapter from `.claude/`; the adapter **delegates** to the
canonical `.github/` file, which exists in the checkout **only because
`grow-lineage.yml` staged it from the hub**. The staging is therefore
**load-bearing**, not cosmetic, and it is stripped before publish so year repos
stay lean. The hub is the single source of truth for the heavy procedures.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Per-repo orchestration (status quo ante)
| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | Med (N crons, peer pollination) |
| Cost | High (framework upkeep re-paid per repo) |
| Scalability | Poor (drift grows with N) |
| Team familiarity | High (already running) |

**Pros:** repos are self-contained; no single point of failure.
**Cons:** framework drift; duplicated heavy toolkit in every repo; no central
throttle/kill-switch; pollination dominates cost.

### Option B: Centralized hub orchestration — adapter + staging (**chosen**)
| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | Med (one engine, one scheduler; the adapter indirection must be understood) |
| Cost | Low (framework maintained once; agents spend only on content) |
| Scalability | Good (add a seed + enable Pages; no per-repo framework) |
| Team familiarity | Med (new mental model) |

**Pros:** single source of truth; lean year repos matching owner intent; one
cadence/throttle; cheap to add a new era.
**Cons:** the adapter→`.github`→staging indirection is non-obvious (a reader can
wrongly conclude the staging is "inert" because discovery uses `.claude/` — see
Consequences); the hub is a single point of failure for growth; cross-repo push
needs `LIFECYCLE_PAT`.

#### Sub-options for the framework mechanism (within B)
- **B1 — adapter + staging (chosen):** year `.claude/` = pointers; hub
  `lineage/framework/` = canonical; staged into `.github/` at tick time. Lean
  repos, true centralization.
- **B2 — sync framework INTO each `.claude/` and publish it:** "true sync." Makes
  the canonical toolkit live in each repo. *Rejected:* fattens every repo, and a
  naive overwrite from the recovered hub copy would **regress** the live adapters
  (verified: hub `framework/` and year `.claude/` are different *representations*,
  not copies — overwriting loses fidelity).
- **B3 — drop staging, year `.claude/` is authoritative; hub copy is reference
  only:** *Rejected:* the adapters dangle (they point at `.github/` files that
  would no longer exist at tick time), **breaking growth**, and it abandons the
  "centralize the framework in the hub" goal.

### Option C: Monorepo (all years in one repo)
| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Complexity | Low-Med |
| Cost | Low |
| Scalability | Poor (one Pages site; loses per-year sites + independent histories) |
| Team familiarity | High |

**Pros:** trivially no drift; one place for everything.
**Cons:** loses the per-year Pages sites and independent identities that are the
product; one giant history; coupled blast radius.

## Trade-off Analysis

The decisive forces were **owner intent** (lean year repos; seed + orchestration
in the hub) and **cost** (stop re-paying for framework upkeep N times). A and C
fail intent — A duplicates the framework; C destroys the per-year sites. Within
B, the real fork is the framework mechanism: B2 and B3 are the "obvious"
alternatives but each breaks something (B2 fattens/regresses repos; B3 breaks the
adapters). **B1 keeps repos lean *and* the hub authoritative** by separating
*discovery* (`.claude/` adapters, shipped in the repo) from *the procedure* (hub
canonical, staged transiently). The price is one non-obvious indirection, paid
down by this ADR + the inline workflow comments.

## Consequences

**Easier**
- Add a new era: write `lineage/seeds/<year>.md`, enable Pages — no per-repo
  framework. (Tangential auto-spawning is the next build.)
- Change a procedure/model once in the hub; every repo gets it next tick.
- One cadence, one throttle, one place to pause growth (don't dispatch).

**Harder / watch-outs**
- The adapter→staging indirection is easy to misread. (During this work it was
  twice mis-assessed as "inert dead weight" before the adapter delegation was
  traced — hence this ADR.) **Do not** "sync framework into `.claude/`" or drop
  the staging without re-reading this.
- The hub is a single point of failure for growth, and cross-repo writes depend
  on `LIFECYCLE_PAT`. If it's unset, the hub tracks but does not grow.
- Agent-written artifacts can drift in format. The first live tick wrote its §8
  entry as an `h2` instead of `h3`, which the ledger parser missed (fixed: the
  parser now tolerates h2/h3 and the enhance prompt pins the exact format).

**To revisit**
- If the org grows to many dozens of repos, reconsider B2 (publish a synced
  `.claude/`) so a human can run a tick locally without the hub stage step.
- If hub-as-SPOF becomes a reliability problem, a thin per-repo fallback cron
  could re-enable degraded self-growth.

## Action Items

1. [x] Centralize seeds, policy, and framework into `lineage/`.
2. [x] Build `grow-lineage.yml` (3-tier escalation + API-key fallback + telemetry
   artifact) and rewire `orchestrate.yml` to dispatch it per repo.
3. [x] Reduce all 10 year repos to content + `_config.yml` + `.claude` +
   `telemetry`; enable Pages.
4. [x] Validate end-to-end on a live repo (`1778`, 2026-06-18) and fix the
   tick-clock format bug it surfaced.
5. [ ] Seed first content into the remaining `seeded` repos (paced rollout).
6. [ ] Build **tangential new-era spawning** from the frontier (uses
   `lineage/seed-package/` + an Opus subject pick) — the one unbuilt feature.
7. [ ] Keep `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` valid (primary model auth); it is the
   growth blocker when it expires.
