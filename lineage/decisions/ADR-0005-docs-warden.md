# ADR-0005: docs-warden — documentation coverage as a fleet agent

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Deciders:** Repo owner (@bamr87)
**Extends:** [ADR-0003](ADR-0003-self-improving-agent-fleet.md) (the self-improvement fleet)

## Context

Across this build the hub accumulated workflows, scripts, ADRs, a genome, and a
fleet — and documentation drifted: e.g. `plant-lineage.rb` and several new
workflows (`codeql`, `framework-pr-reviewer`) shipped without a CLAUDE.md entry,
and `.github/config/environment.yml` pins Ruby 3.2 while every workflow inlines
3.3. The existing reviewers cover only slices: `ai-content-review` (pages prose),
`framework-pr-reviewer` (framework safety), `genome-sync` (genome drift). Nothing
guaranteed that **every change is matched by a doc update** — the goal of
complete coverage of all changes/improvements/additions.

## Decision

Add **docs-warden**, an ADR-0003 fleet agent (UPDATE/GOVERN stage) for the hub's
own doc surface, in four files:

- `.github/config/docs_warden.yml` — the editable **change→doc coverage map**,
  the doc-exempt predicate, the bot-commit allowlist, and the `enforcement` knob.
- `scripts/docs-warden.rb` — the deterministic engine: `--base` (PR coverage) +
  `--census` (drift); `--json`/`--summary`/`--check`.
- `.github/workflows/docs-warden.yml` — **gate** (PR), **sweep** (weekly + manual
  drift census → an issue), kill-switch aware.
- `.github/instructions/docs-warden.instructions.md` — the contract.

It is the hub analogue of the member-repo `claude-md-canon-warden`. It does **not**
overlap the three existing reviewers.

## Key design choices

- **Gate + sweep ⇒ 100% commit coverage.** PRs are caught by the gate; the no-PR
  automated commits (grow ticks, ledger appends, dashboard refreshes) are observed
  by the sweep. The exempt set + bot allowlist keep it silent on the ~90% of
  commits that are legitimately doc-free.
- **Exempt set is decoupled from the genome `ignore` tier.** "Does it transplant?"
  ≠ "does it need a doc?" — `CLAUDE.md`/ADRs are genome-ignored yet are prime doc
  targets, so they are not exempt.
- **Seed grow-commits are exempt by committer + message**, not by section: the
  grow tick git-adds the whole seed, so a section filter would flag every tick.
- **Read-only / PR-not-direct** (ADR-0003): the gate comments, the sweep files an
  issue. No commit/push/merge. Kill-switch (`_data/fleet_pause.yml`) honored first.
- **`enforcement: warn`** at rollout (always advises, never blocks) → `soft-gate`
  (dismissible) → `hard-gate`, tuned in config without editing the workflow.

## Consequences

- **Easier:** undocumented changes become visible (the warden caught its own
  predecessors' gaps — `codeql.yml`, `framework-pr-reviewer.yml` — on first run),
  and adding a new surface to the map is itself a tracked change, so the map can't
  silently rot.
- **Watch-outs:** the map must be extended when a genuinely new surface appears
  (the UNKNOWN-surface note is the forcing function). An auto-drafting
  companion-doc-PR mode is deferred (a second mutation surface; doc-only allowlist
  if ever built).

## Action Items
1. [x] Build the four files; validate the census catches real drift.
2. [x] Document the warden itself + the accumulated drift in CLAUDE.md; register
   in `/self-improvement/`.
3. [ ] Fix the surfaced drift (`environment.yml` 3.2→3.3; Cloudflare secrets doc).
4. [ ] Flip `enforcement` to `soft-gate` and add the gate to required checks once
   the map is tuned.
