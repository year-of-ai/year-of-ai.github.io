# CLAUDE.md

This repository is a **self-growing knowledge base** in the
[`year-of-ai`](https://github.com/year-of-ai) lineage. It holds only its own
**content**, a GitHub Pages `_config.yml` (a `remote_theme` consumer of
[`bamr87/zer0-mistakes`](https://github.com/bamr87/zer0-mistakes)), the `.claude/`
adapter toolkit, and `telemetry/`.

## How it grows — it does not grow itself

Growth is orchestrated **centrally by the hub**
(`year-of-ai/year-of-ai.github.io`). On each tick the hub checks out this repo,
stages the canonical agent framework into `.github/` and this repo's concept seed
as `seed.md`, runs a **Haiku → Sonnet → Opus** escalation to research and write
new content, then publishes **only** the new content + telemetry back here. The
seed, the growth policy, and the framework all live in the hub, never in this
repo. See the hub's [orchestration model](https://year-of-ai.github.io/orchestration/).

## Conventions

- **Content** lives under the taxonomy category directories defined by this
  repo's seed; each topic is one Markdown file with `title` / `date` / `category`
  front matter, written in a factual, neutral, encyclopedic, third-person tone,
  with every fact verified against ≥2 sources.
- **`date:` must be a single plain ISO date** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) — never a range
  (`"1777–1778"`), a bare year, or prose. One unparseable date fails this
  site's **whole** Pages build; use the start date for ranges and
  `YYYY-01-01` when only the year is known.
- **`.claude/` is adapters only.** The skills (`.claude/skills/`) and commands
  (`.claude/commands/`) are thin pointers; their canonical procedures are staged
  from the hub under `.github/` at tick time. `seed.md` is likewise present only
  during a tick.
- **`README.md` is the site homepage** (`jekyll-readme-index`). Don't add theme
  files (`_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`) — the theme is remote.
