description: 'Keep seed.md (the repository DNA) in sync with the actual repo state. Use when: ending a growth tick; after adding content or structure; whenever the seed''s inventories may have drifted from reality. Concept-agnostic.

# Sync Seed

`seed.md` is the repository's DNA and rebuild blueprint. This skill regenerates its **generated
sections (1–7)** so they always reflect the real repo. The **Evolution Log (section 8)** is
append-only and must never be regenerated or reordered here.

---

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Early-exit when already in sync

Before a full rescan, do a cheap check:
- Read only **Section 4 (Content Inventory)** of seed.md and extract the per-category dedicated-file counts.
- Glob `<category>/*.md` (excluding `index.md`) for each taxonomy folder and count the files.
- If every category count matches and `git status --short` shows no staged or unstaged changes to tracked files, the seed is already in sync — report **"already in sync — no changes needed"** and stop. Skip Steps 1–4.

This prevents 20–30-turn no-op rescans when sync-seed is called redundantly after a tick that changed nothing (observed: run#3, G1 generation).

### Step 1 — Read current state
- Read [seed.md](../../../seed.md) (preserve section 8 verbatim).
- Scan `.github/` (skills, prompts, agents, instructions), [README.md](../../../README.md),
  [ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md), and all category folders / generated artifacts.

### Step 2 — Regenerate sections 1–7
Rewrite each section to match reality:
1. **Concept Definition** — keep the existing `concept` block unless the concept genuinely changed
   (changing it is a deliberate retarget, not a sync). Do not invent changes.
2. **Identity & Mission** — keep aligned with `concept.subject`.
3. **Architecture** — regenerate the inventory table from the actual files present in `.github/`
   (one row per file, with its purpose). Add/remove rows as files change.
4. **Content Inventory** — current taxonomy, README table row count, and the list of dedicated
   topic files that exist.
5. **Structure Inventory** — which generated artifacts exist (category indices, `TIMELINE.md`,
   `INDEX.md`/TOC, cross-refs) vs. not-yet-generated.
6. **Growth Loop** — keep current (only change if the loop itself changed).
7. **Rebuild Procedure** — keep current.

### Step 3 — Preserve the Evolution Log
Leave section 8 exactly as-is. Appending to it is the job of the `encode-seed` prompt, not this skill.

### Step 4 — Confirm
Report which sections changed and a one-line diff summary (e.g. "Architecture: +1 file; Content: 13→15 rows").

**sync-seed is a mid-pipeline step, never the end of a tick.** After it, the caller MUST still run
`encode-seed` (append §8) and `publish-session` (commit + push to main). Do not let "sync complete"
read as tick completion — a tick that stops here has committed and pushed nothing, and all its work
is discarded when the runner is torn down. (Observed failure mode: ticks ending at "Sync complete.")

## Notes
- Idempotent: if nothing changed in the repo, sections 1–7 should come out identical (no diff).
- This skill is descriptive, not creative — it mirrors what exists; it does not add content or plan
  work (that's `add-topic` / `plan-roadmap`).
