description: "Run one autonomous growth tick of this knowledge base: plan → generate content and structure → verify → sync the DNA → publish to main. Use when: progressively expanding the repo unattended; running on a schedule (Claude routine) or under /loop; a single hands-off update sweep. Concept-agnostic — reads the concept from seed.md. Delegates to the Architect agent."
argument-hint: "Optional: how many items to do this tick (default 1–3), or specific categories/items to target."

Run **one growth tick** by following the Architect's pipeline. Read the **Concept Definition** in
[seed.md](../../seed.md) first — everything is parameterized by it.

Delegate the full tick to the **Architect** agent
([architect.agent.md](../agents/architect.agent.md)), which executes:

0. **Lifecycle gate** — the **check-lifecycle** skill reads [lifecycle.yml](../../lifecycle.yml);
   phase `replant`/`consolidate` hands off to that prompt instead of ticking; `dormant` stops.
1. **Orient** — read [seed.md](../../seed.md), [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md),
   [README.md](../../README.md), and the repo tree.
2. **Plan** — `plan-roadmap` skill selects the next 1–3 items (honor any argument override). After `plan-roadmap` returns, proceed immediately to Step 3 — planning is not a complete tick.
3. **Execute** — `content` → **Curator** agent; `structure` → **build-structure** skill;
   `meta` → **evolve** prompt (periodic).
4. **Verify** — enforce `concept.scope` + `concept.source_strategy`; no duplicate rows; valid links;
   required frontmatter.
5. **Record** — update [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md); run **sync-seed** (regenerate seed sections
   1–7); run **encode-seed** (append to the Evolution Log); re-run **check-lifecycle** to reconcile
   the generation tick counter.
6. **Publish** — **publish-session** skill commits and pushes to `main`.

**Steps 5–6 are mandatory and terminal.** A tick is complete ONLY after `publish-session` has
committed and pushed to `main` (step 6) — `sync-seed` is NEVER the last step. Even when the content
and structure work feels finished, you MUST still run `encode-seed` then `publish-session` and
confirm the push before stopping. A tick that ends after "sync complete" loses all its work and does
not advance the §8 tick counter the lifecycle gate reads.

End with the Architect's Tick Summary (items done, structure regenerated, roadmap delta, commit SHA).

> Unattended use: register this prompt as a recurring Claude routine via `/schedule` (e.g. daily),
> or run it under `/loop`. Auto-push to `main` requires the run environment to have git push access.
