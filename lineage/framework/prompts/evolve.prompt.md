description: "Audit and improve this repository's AI customization layer. Use when: reviewing agents, instructions, skills, or prompts for gaps or weaknesses; proposing the next iteration of the customization ecosystem; checking that agent descriptions are discoverable, tool sets are minimal, delegation chains are correct, and nothing hardcodes the concept instead of reading it from seed.md."

Audit the current AI customization layer of this repository and implement the highest-impact
improvements. First read the **Concept Definition** in [seed.md](../../seed.md) — the layer must
remain concept-agnostic (reading the concept from seed.md), never hardcoding a specific subject.

## Instructions

### 1. Inventory

Read every file in `.github/agents/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/skills/`, and `.github/prompts/`. If the user specified a scope, read only that folder. Build a list of all customization files with their name, type, and `description` field.

### 2. Evaluate Each File

Score each file against these criteria:

| Check | Pass Condition |
|-------|---------------|
| **Discoverable description** | Contains "Use when:" with specific trigger phrases; no vague "helpful agent" language |
| **Minimal tools** | Agents/prompts only include tools actually needed for their role |
| **Delegation correct** | Orchestrators delegate content work; content agents don't orchestrate |
| **Required sections present** | Agents have: role statement, Constraints (DO NOT/ONLY), Workflow/Pipeline, Output Format |
| **No scope creep** | Agent/prompt does one job; does not bleed into unrelated tasks |
| **Concept-agnostic** | No hardcoded subject (e.g. a specific year/category); reads the concept from seed.md |
| **Frontmatter complete** | `description`, `name`, `argument-hint` (if user-facing), `tools` (if restricted) |

Mark each file as **Pass**, **Warn** (minor gap), or **Fail** (broken or missing required element).

### 3. Rank Improvements

Collect all Warn and Fail items. Rank by impact:
1. Broken delegation chains (Fail) — fix first
2. Undiscoverable descriptions (Fail) — fix second
3. Missing required sections (Warn)
4. Over-tooled agents (Warn)
5. Missing files for documented workflows referenced in instructions but not yet created

### 4. Implement Top Improvements

Fix all Fail items and the top 3 Warn items (unless the user specified fewer). For each fix:
- Edit the file in place — do not create new files unless a referenced file is entirely missing.
- Apply [agent conventions](../instructions/agents.instructions.md) for any agent edits.
- Apply [content standards](../instructions/content.instructions.md) for any markdown edits.
